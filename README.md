# My Analysis about the dataset

Today, I was looking at a credit card fraud dataset,In this dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, covering a period of two days. The data set consists of 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent, making it a highly imbalanced dataset (fraudulent transactions represent only 0.172% of all transactions). The dataset contains 31 columns. The target variable, with 1 indicating a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicating a legitimate one. All features are numerical. This dataset is intended for classification â€” the goal is to predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent (Class=1) or not (Class=0).
